# Drop Zone

Diff technical interview question.

## Project Overview

Thank you for taking the time to view my submission of Drop-Zone loading page for the Diff Front-End technical interview. I have chosen to have the default date be set to 13 days, 8 hours, 12 mins and 5 seconds when the page loads. If you wish to set a date for the page to load on instead, you can do so in the src > components > Countdown.vue line 33. You can also do so by uncommenting line 34. I have tested with the screen sizes 1440 x 722 for the Desktop and 375 x 667 on the iphone 8 as indicated in the Figma Mockup. This project is using the Vue.js framework as well as some bootstrap for positioning and scss for styling. I also used a few extensions to help with setting rules for code styling.

Below are the commands to run for setup and compiling

### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Instructions
